# CRUD Simple app V3

This mini project is version 3 from the app with the same name. This version includes the functionality to create a user profile, which allows you to save custom tasks in a TODO list, enhancing further the **CRUD** methodology. 

This mini project is part of the exercises done in my specialization course about **React JS** and **Redux** taught in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-react-js/), and also this project makes use of the **Firestore** database and the Firebase host.
